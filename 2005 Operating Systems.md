# Operating Systems
Essentially a piece of code which controls and coordinates the use of hardware among various programs for various users.
## Types of OS
1. Batch Systems: batch similar jobs which automatically transfers control from one job to another
	- Only 1 job in memory at any time
	- When job waits for IO, the CPU is idle
2. Multiprogram / Time-sharing Systems: several jobs are kept in main memory at the same time
3. Embedded Systems: physical systems where operations are controlled by computing

The OS is typically [[Interrupts]] driven.

## Functions of the OS
