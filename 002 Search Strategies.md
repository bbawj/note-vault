# Search Strategies
#moc
## Factors for search
- Completeness: Does it always find a solution if one exists?
- Optimality: Does it always find the best solution? [Shortest Path Problem](Notes/Shortest%20Path%20Problem.md)
- Average Branching Factor: average number of successors of any node $$ABF=No.of\ Nodes/No.of\ non\ leaf\ nodes$$
- ## Uninformed Search
	- [Depth First Search](Notes/Depth%20First%20Search.md)
	- [Breadth First Search](Notes/Breadth%20First%20Search.md)
	- [Iterative Deepening Search](Notes/Iterative%20Deepening%20Search.md)
	- Path Cost
		- [Uniform Cost Search](Notes/Uniform%20Cost%20Search.md)
		- [Dijkstra's Algorithm](Notes/Dijkstra's%20Algorithm.md)
- ## Informed Search (Heuristics)
	- [Greedy Best First Search](Notes/Greedy%20Best%20First%20Search.md)
	- [A-Star Search](Notes/A-Star%20Search.md)
