**Good morning Minister Chan Chun Sing and fellow members of the team. I am Brendan, a computer science and business student from NTU and I am here today to share about KidsCode.

Singapore is increasing its emphasis on digitization for much of our core systems. In this year's National Day Rally, Prime Minister LHL gave an update on the Tuas Port. It will incorporate the use of Artificial Intelligence in order to streamline port services such as vessel traffic management and port clearance. Effective development and application of technology will allow it to support upwards of 65 million TEUs of cargo. (include some stats)

Moreover, Mr Lee also spoke about the importance of top talent to the prosperity and success of SG's future. And without a doubt, building up home grown talent in the field of information technology will be key to sustaining the backbone of much of the services which keeps Singapore running. (maybe stats here is better?)

To achieve this, I believe that we must start young. Your ministry also believes the same, and have already started its own enrichment programme, Code For Fun, which offers a 10 hour curriculum to all primary and secondary school students. 

This programme is a good start, but more needs to be done in terms of offering a more in-depth curriculum that is also widely available. Currently, one solution for children wanting to learn more is through external commercial centers which offers children focused coding programmes. 

However, this means that some kids are being left behind. Underprivileged families, who may find these skills important but yet cannot afford to send their children for commercial classes are stuck. The aim of KidsCode is to fill this gap by providing a free, professional and in-depth curriculum for children of these underprivileged families.

_What will CITC do?_
KidsCode will aim to develop computational thinking skills in the children that participate. What is computational thinking? Simply put, it is the ability to think like a computer. Fret not, this does not mean that we will be stifling the creative minds of our youth, but rather the opposite. Computational thinking is the ability to use logical and structured ways to break down difficult problems, and to encourage the use creativity to come up with novel solutions. 
These are problem-solving skills which will help them through a myriad of challenges that they will face later in life.Â 

The best way to do this, is through the direct application of technology to problem solving. KidsCode will offer a program focused on coding and tinkering to hone these skills, but at the same time aim to inculcate other important values such as resilience and confidence through mentorship and project presentations.

KidsCode will run with the support of volunteers. We will start with volunteers from Singapore's local universities. Student interest groups with a passion for technology and wish to be part of the kid's learning journey will form the backbone of our curriculum. As the technical director in NTU Open Source Society, our team will be the first to contribute to this initiative.

_types of classes_
To begin with, we will offer 2 types of classes which will cater to different age groups. For 8-12 year olds, we will offer lessons in Scratch, a kid friendly but still powerful programming language. 
 For 13-16 year olds, we will offer lessons in python, a simple yet extremely powerful programming language capable of building complex systems.

_maybe might not have time for this_
Each class will also be split into different difficulty levels, such that kids can
