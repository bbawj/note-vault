# What even is this site?! 

Hi, I'm Brendan, a computer science student at Nanyang Technological University. 

Here, there are summarised notes of interesting topics and some entries of my personal ramblings. I sort of like writing? I remember creating my own silly versions of children's books when I was little, filled with aliens and dragons or something. I know, I am such a novelist.
