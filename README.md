# Note Vault
This vault is meant to be used as a backup and syncing tool for _most_ of the notes I make for the NTU Business and Computing course AY19/20 and the learning of new and interesting topics in computer science. 

### Viewing the Notes
The files in this repository are not written using [GitHub flavoured markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), and will not render properly on the browser. They are written using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a personal knowledge base application and hence includes important internal linking syntax _"\[\[ \]\]"_ which helps organize the flow and linkages to various topics.

### Navigating
__Module specific content__ are structured under 4 digit codes _e.g. 2101 Algorithm Design and Analysis_ corresponding to the course code in NTU. They contain the links to notes relevant to the course but may contain more information than in the examinable syllabus. 

__Important topics__ are structured under 3 digit codes _e.g. 001 Search Strategies_ which are meant to help provide a more cohesive method to study big branches of knowledge.
