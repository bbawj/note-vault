# Query Compiler
An SQL query is *declarative* - does not specify the procedure for query execution. 
The compiler is responsible for transforming a query into a set of instructions:
## 1. [Query Parsing and Preprocessing](Query%20Parsing%20and%20Preprocessing)
## 2. [Query Optimisation](Notes/Query%20Optimisation.md)
