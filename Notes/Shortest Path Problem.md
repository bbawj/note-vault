# Shortest Path Problem

In [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory"), the **shortest path problem** is the problem of finding a [path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory) "Path (graph theory)") between two [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory) "Vertex (graph theory)") (or nodes) in a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics) "Graph (discrete mathematics)") such that the sum of the [weights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms#weighted_graph "Glossary of graph theory terms") of its constituent edges is minimized.

Shortest can also mean the number of edges.
