# Reconciliation Sublayer (RS)
The purpose of this interface is to provide a simple, inexpensive, and easy-to-implement interconnection between MACs and PHYs

## PLS
Physical Layer Signaling. Just some abstract primitives and services for communication between PHY and MAC.
![](Pics/Pasted%20image%2020240923104353.png)
 - DATA Request: maps the data to the MII signals TXD<3:0>, TX_EN and TX_CLK
 ![](Pics/Pasted%20image%2020241119135021.png)
 - CARRIER: transfers the status of activity on the line.  CARRIER_ON = input message, CARRIER_OFF = idle message
## PLCA
PHY Layer Collision Avoidance. An optional feature that can increase bandwidth in high traffic environments meant to tackle limitations of [[CSMA/CSMA-CD]]

### How it works...
Transmit Opportunities (TO) are generated in a round-robin fashion. The node with ID = 0 signals a BEACON on the medium. Reception of a BEACON indicates the start of a new cycle of transmit opportunities. If the node with ID = 0 fails, the network is still operational with the same performance level of a CSMA/CD network without PLCA.
Each node is allowed to transmit a single packet during its own transmit opportunity. Individual nodes can be enabled to transmit a number of additional packets, up to the configured limit, within the same transmit opportunity.
PLCA relies on the PLS_SIGNAL.indication and PLS_CARRIER.indication primitives to have the MAC delay transmission until a transmit opportunity is available
### State Diagrams
Essentially
- curID: used to track the node that owns the TO
- to_timer: timer counting down the TO

# MII/GMII
(Gigabit) Media independent interface. It's just a name for the standardized interface for connecting different PHYs to the MAC. It functions as a way to allow the MMI to talk to a Manageable Device (MMD). It allows Station Management entities (STA; i.e. could just be some management program or something) to:
- determine PHY capabilities
	- read/write registers on PHY
	- does the PHY support GMII?
- configure the station
### Encoding
Sending data over the MMI uses a specific frame encoding (802.3 22.2.4 onwards)
![](Pics/Pasted%20image%2020240923112436.png)
- PRE: preamble of 32 contiguous 1 bits
- ST:  start of frame 
- OP: read (10) / write (01)
- PHYAD: address of the PHY
- REGAD: allows accessing 32 individual registers in the PHY. For more registers see [MDIO](#MDIO)
### Accessing Clause 45 MMI's  with Clause 22
Registers 13 and 14 provides a way to communicate with a Clause 45 MMD. Access to register 14 will access the register addressed by register 14 if control register is set appropriately.

## MDIO
Management Data Input/Output (Clause 45 ref 45.3 onwards). It provides indirect access for more registers.

Clause 45 MMD's provide a 16bit address register that is written to during address cycles, or used for indirect access to the register address they contain for data cycles.
### Encoding
![](Pics/Pasted%20image%2020240923132212.png)
- ST: <00> pattern instead of <01>
- OP: importantly, <00> will define the address of the register to be used for data cycles
