# Longest Path Problem
It is the problem of finding a simple path of maximum length in a given graph. 

Simple path: if it does not have any repeated vertices; the length of a path may either be measured by its number of edges, or (in weighted graphs) by the sum of the weights of its edges. 

In contrast to the [Shortest Path Problem](Notes/Shortest%20Path%20Problem.md), which can be solved in polynomial time in graphs without negative-weight cycles, the longest path problem is [](Notes/P%20and%20NP%20Problems.md#NP%20Hard%20Problems%7CNP-Hard) and the decision version of the problem, which asks whether a path exists of at least some given length, is [](Notes/P%20and%20NP%20Problems.md#NP%20Complete%20Problems%7CNP-complete).
