# Pseudo-Polynomial Time Complexity
The runtime is some polynomial _in the numeric value of the input_, rather than in the number of bits required to represent it.

> [!NOTE] Knapsack Problem
> The DP time complexity is $O(nC)$ where C is the capacity of the bag and n is the number of items. Capacity C needs log(C) bits to represent. If x is the number of bits, $x = log(C), C = 2^x$. 
> 
> This is exponential in the number of bits.
