# Capital Budgeting
### NPV
Net Present Value: calculate the present value of future cash flows in order to whether a project is worth up taking $NPV_1\ge NPV_2$.
#### Calculating NPV of projects

NOWC: This is the net change in accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory during the measurement period. __An increase in working capital uses cash, while a decrease produces cash.

##### Unequal Life Projects (Fixed term)

### IRR
Rate of return which makes the NPV of a project = 0.
A higher IRR is better. _Intuitively, if the IRR is higher, this means that the cashflows are equivalent to returns at that level of interest rate_.

Dependent only on the cashflows and not the required return.

Cons:
- Non conventional cashflows makes IRR method unreliable as there may be more than 1 IRR
- The IRR can also be 0
- Assumes cash flows are reinvested at the IRR and not the WACC (unrealistic)

Relationship to NPV:
- IRR and NPV gives the same decision for independent projects. 
- NPV should be used for mutually exclusive projects
#### Choosing between projects (Crossover rate)
Crossover rate is the rate which we are indifferent between 2 projects. Both projects have NPV = 0.

### MIRR
The internal rate of return which makes the present value of cash outflows = to the present value of the terminal value (FV of cash inflows) of the project.

Handles the IRR problem by combining cash flows into (-) sign cash flow at time 0 and 1 (+) sign cash flow at terminal year.
