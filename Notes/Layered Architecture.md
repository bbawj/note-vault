# Layered Architecture
![](https://i.imgur.com/zKXvw5b.png)

## Pros
1. Separation of concern: This allows us to focus on a smaller scope of problems in each layer, as opposed to looking at the problem across different layers
2. Isolation: Each layer is decoupled, thus modifications in one layer will not affect downstream layers
3. Changeability: Can easily replace one whole layer with another, while interface is still maintained
4. Scalability
## Cons
1. Performance overhead: more pronounced when more layers are added
