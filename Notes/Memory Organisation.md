# Memory Organisation
## Address Binding
A program needs to be loaded into memory to run. The machine code that is generated needs to be mapped to memory addresses in the system.

Possible binding stages:
1. Compile time: memory location is known a priori, generating **absolute code** that must be recompiled if the starting location changes
2. Load time: compiler generates **relocatable code** and the binding is performed by the loader.

3. Execution time: binding is delayed until run time and the process can be moved during its execution from one memory segment to another. Uses a logical address that is relative to a starting 0 point.

## Memory Allocation
How to assign memory to different processes?
### Contiguous allocation
Logical address space of process remains contiguous in physical memory.
#### Fixed partitioning
Memory is partitioned into regions with fixed boundaries. OS decides which partition to assign a process to depending on the available partitions.

*Internal fragmentation*: as each partition is fixed, a process assigned to a partition might not take up the entire space of the partition, resulting in wasted unusable memory internal to the partition. 
#### Dynamic partitioning
Do not partition the memory. Rather, the OS allocates the exact chunk of memory which a process requires, and keeps tracks of *holes* or available blocks of memory.

*External fragmentation*: memory space between partitions (the holes) may be enough to satisfy a new request but is not contiguous and cannot be used. This can be solved by performing compaction, which shuffles memory contents to produce contiguous block of available memory.
