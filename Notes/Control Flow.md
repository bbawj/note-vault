# Control Flow
## Conditional Execution
Adding the if statement to grammar:
```
statement      → exprStmt
               | ifStmt
               | printStmt
               | block ;

ifStmt         → "if" "(" expression ")" statement
               ( "else" statement )? ;
```
In java:
```java
 private Stmt ifStatement() {
    consume(LEFT_PAREN, "Expect '(' after 'if'.");
    Expr condition = expression();
    consume(RIGHT_PAREN, "Expect ')' after if condition."); 

    Stmt thenBranch = statement();
    Stmt elseBranch = null;
    if (match(ELSE)) {
      elseBranch = statement();
    }

    return new Stmt.If(condition, thenBranch, elseBranch);
  }
```
### Dangling Else Problem
The else clause is optional. Most parsers bind the else to the nearest if that precedes it.

## Logical Operators
Updated grammar:
```
expression     → assignment ;
assignment     → IDENTIFIER "=" assignment
               | logic_or ;
logic_or       → logic_and ( "or" logic_and )* ;
logic_and      → equality ( "and" equality )* ;
```
## While loops
Updated grammar:
```
statement      → exprStmt
               | ifStmt
               | printStmt
               | whileStmt
               | block ;

whileStmt      → "while" "(" expression ")" statement ;
```
