# Dijkstra's Algorithm
[Shortest Path Problem](Notes/Shortest%20Path%20Problem.md)
Find the shortest path from source to all other vertices. 

> [!NOTE] Adding a positive constant to all edges
> Dijkstra finds the shortest path in terms of the edge weights and not the number of edges. Hence, the shortest path may contain many edges. __This means that a change in edge weights will result in a different shortest path unless the number of edges in each path is the same.__

> [!NOTE] Multiplying all edges by a positive constant

> This leads to a contradiction as Q is now a shorter path than P but P is the shortest path in G.

Assumptions:
**Weights must be nonnegative**

We can also obtain the number of distinct shortest paths by using an additional n-size array to store the counts of paths which have the same shortest distance:
