# Custom Computing
Custom computers are special-purpose systems customised for specific applications such as signal processing and database operations, when general-purpose computers are too slow, too bulky or consume too much power.

## General Purpose Processors (GPP)

## Application Specific Instruction Set Processor (ASIP)
Flexibility should just be sufficient instead of unlimited in the case of a GPP. Want to achieve highest performance with minimum power consumption.
### Digital Signal Processor
Architecture designed for repetitive multiply-accumulate operations and bit-reversal addressing
### GPU

### Field Programmable Gate Array (FGPA)
The FGPA has an edge over the DSP by supporting parallel designs and greater performance

### Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC)
With more customization, the ASIC can achieve lower power consumption but results in inflexibility.
