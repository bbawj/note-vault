## Dual mode operation
Differentiates between at least 2 modes of operations
1. User mode: execution of user processes
2. __Monitor mode__ (supervisor/system/kernel mode): execution of operating system processes

> [!NOTE]
> Kernel mode is not the same as root/admin privileges. Kernel or user modes are hardware operation moes while the root/admin is just a user account in the OS. 
> 
> The root/admin may execute code in kernel mode indirectly.
