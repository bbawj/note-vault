# Broadcast Abstractions
## Unreliable Broadcast
Does not guarantee anything. Such events are allowed:

## Best Effort Broadcast
Guarantees reliability only if sender is correct
- BEB1. Best-effort-Validity: If pi and pj are correct, then any broadcast by pi is eventually delivered by pj  
- BEB2. No duplication: No message delivered more than once  
- BEB3. No creation: No message delivered unless broadcast

### Implementation
We can use perfect links:
Upon <beb Broadcast | m>send message m to all processes (for-loop)  
Correctness  
- If sender doesnâ€™t crash, every other correct process receives message by perfect channels (Validity)  
- No creation & No duplication already guaranteed by perfect channels

## Reliable Broadcast
BEB gives no guarantees if sender crashes. Reliable strengthens this by giving guarantees even if sender crashes.
- RB1 = BEB1. Validity  
- RB2 = BEB2. No duplication  
- RB3 = BEB3. No creation  
- RB4. Agreement. If a correct process delivers m, then every correct process delivers m

### Fail Stop (Lazy) Implementation

- Perfect failure detector (P): use this to detect when process crash
- BEB: use this to redistribute messages when detect a crash from a process
Case 1: detect crash and redistribute
Case 2: delivered message, detect crash and redistribute

#### Performance
Message complexity: best case O(N), worst case O(N^2)
Time complexity: best case 1 round. worst case 2 rounds
### Fail Silent (Eager)
No failure detector necessary. A pessimistic approach that just redistributes any message by assuming that the process has failed.

## Uniform Reliable Broadcast
Reliable broadcast creates a problem. If a failed process delivers a message that has a side effect (such as withdrawing some money from an account), the correct processes need not deliver (know of) this side effect.
- URB1 = RB1.  
- URB2 = RB2.  
- URB3 = RB3.  
- URB4. Uniform Agreement: For any message m, if a process delivers m, then every correct process delivers m

### Fail Silent
Correctness assumption: a majority of processes are always correct. Resilience is N/2 machines can fail

## Causal Broadcast
- Causality between broadcast events is preserved by the corresponding delivery events  
- If broadcast(m1) happens-before broadcast(m2), any delivery(m2) cannot happen-before a delivery(m1)

### Fail Silent
Each broadcasted messages carries a history which can be used to ensure causality before delivery. The history is an ordered list of casually preceding messages in the past.
