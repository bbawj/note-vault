# Broadcast Abstractions
## Unreliable Broadcast
Does not guarantee anything. Such events are allowed:

## Best Effort Broadcast
Guarantees reliability only if sender is correct
- BEB1. Best-effort-Validity: If pi and pj are correct, then any broadcast by pi is eventually delivered by pj  
- BEB2. No duplication: No message delivered more than once  
- BEB3. No creation: No message delivered unless broadcast

### Implementation
We can use perfect links:
Upon <beb Broadcast | m>send message m to all processes (for-loop)  
Correctness  
- If sender doesnâ€™t crash, every other correct process receives message by perfect channels (Validity)  
- No creation & No duplication already guaranteed by perfect channels

## Reliable Broadcast
BEB gives no guarantees if sender crashes. Reliable strengthens this by giving guarantees even if sender crashes. Guarantee: either all correct processes deliver m or none of them.
- RB1 = BEB1. Validity  
- RB2 = BEB2. No duplication  
- RB3 = BEB3. No creation  
- RB4. Agreement. If a correct process delivers m, then every correct process delivers m

### Fail Stop (Lazy) Implementation
![](https://i.imgur.com/96xQG2C.png)
- Perfect failure detector (P): use this to detect when process crash
	- If P is replaced with [Eventually perfect failure detector](Notes/Failure%20Detectors.md#Eventually%20perfect%20failure%20detector): eventual strong accuracy means that some correct processes may be suspected as crashed. However, since we redistribute messages on crash, no property is violated.
- BEB: use this to redistribute messages when detect a crash from a process
Case 1: detect crash and redistribute
Case 2: delivered message, detect crash and redistribute

#### Performance
Message complexity: best case O(N), worst case O(N^2)
Time complexity: best case 1 round. worst case 2 rounds
### Fail Silent (Eager)
No failure detector necessary. A pessimistic approach that just redistributes any message by assuming that the process has failed.

## Uniform Reliable Broadcast
Reliable broadcast creates a problem. If a failed process delivers a message that has a side effect (such as withdrawing some money from an account), the correct processes need not deliver (know of) this side effect.
- URB1 = RB1.  
- URB2 = RB2.  
- URB3 = RB3.  
- URB4. Uniform Agreement: For any message m, if a process delivers m, then every correct process delivers m
### Eager (Fail-stop)
Intuition: deliver the message only when we know that every other correct process can deliver the message. If we do not wait for all correct processes (or we do not have the complete set of failed processes using a weaker FD), we might deliver m even though some correct processes did not receive the message, violating agreement.

### Majority-ACK (Fail Silent)
Correctness assumption: a majority of processes are always correct. Resilience is N/2 machines can fail

## Causal Broadcast
[Causality](Notes/Distributed%20Abstractions.md#Causality) between broadcast events is preserved by the corresponding delivery events  
- If broadcast(m1) happens-before broadcast(m2), any delivery(m2) cannot happen-before a delivery(m1)
- However, delivering m2 by itself still preserves causal order.

### Examples

- 3 caused the broadcast of 2, causal order is preserved for {3,2,1} or {3,1,2}

### Reliable (Fail Silent)
Each broadcasted messages carries a history which can be used to ensure causality before delivery. The history is an ordered list of casually preceding messages in the past.

## Orderings
- Single source FIFO order: delivery is ordered in FIFO order for deliveries of its own broadcasts
- Total order: order of delivery is the same across all processes
- Causal order: [Causality](Notes/Distributed%20Abstractions.md#Causality)
