# Computer Power
## Power dissipation
### Dynamic Power
Dissipated only when computation is performed

### Static Power
Due to leakage current and dissipated whenever the system is powered on

## Reducing power consumption
1. Component design
2. Power gating: shutting down unused components
3. Clock gating: reduce unnecessary switching
4. Reduce data movement, number of memory access and register transfer
