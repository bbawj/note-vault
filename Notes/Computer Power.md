# Computer Power
## Power dissipation
### Dynamic Power
Dissipated only when computation is performed

### Static Power
Due to leakage current and dissipated whenever the system is powered on

### Total Power

When voltage is reduced, the threshold that is used to differentiate between a logic 1 and logic 0 output will be reduced. If this threshold is small, a high frequency will be more prone to noise that could alter the output.
## Reducing power consumption
1. Component design
2. Power gating: shutting down unused components
3. Clock gating: reduce unnecessary switching
4. Reduce data movement, number of memory access and register transfer
