# Software Model Checking
[Model Checking](Notes/Model%20Checking.md) is traditionally applied to protocols/algorithms and specifications. Software model checking tries to find failures in well, software.

Software model checking tools can backtrack and explore different [thread schedules](Notes/Threads.md) for a concurrent program and in the process find all possible failures.
## Java Pathfinder
[Java Pathfinder](https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core) is a software model checker for Java bytecode. 

An example with the [Dining Philosophers problem](Notes/Process%20Synchronization.md#Dining%20Philosophers):

In QueueTest, there are only 2 workers, each having to put data first before removing data. If the queue is full or there is no data for the respective operations, they wait. The signal from notify() can only be lost if 1 worker finishes execution before the 2nd worker begins. However, in that case, the queue would be empty and the 2nd worker would not need to wait() in the first place.
