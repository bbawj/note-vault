# Virtualization
A technique that uses software called Hypervisor (virtual machine manager or VMM) to create abstraction of hardware.
- Hardware is divided into multiple virtual computers, called Virtual Machines (VMs) 
- Each VM runs its own OS, called Guest OS, and behaves like an independent computer !Application processes can run on the guest OS as if it is an independent computer
- Each VM is using only a portion of the actual hardware
## Purpose
More efficient utilisation of hardware
- Cost effective hardware deployment and sharing
- Low latency and agile execution environments
- Failure mitigation (VM independence and migrations)
Enables cloud computing
