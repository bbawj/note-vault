# Binary Trees
A tree structure in which each node has at most 2 children.
```javascript
class TreeNode {
	constructor(val, left, right, parent){
		this.val = val
		this.left = left
		this.right = right
		// this.parent = parent
	}
}
```
## Properties of binary trees
Full binary trees (all nodes have 0 or 2 children)
- The number of nodes n in a full binary tree is at least $2h+1$ and at most $2^{h+1}-1$, where h is the height of the tree. A tree consisting of only a root node has a height of 0.
- The number of leaf nodes l in a perfect binary tree, is $\frac{(n+1)}{2}$ because the number of non-leaf (a.k.a. internal) nodes $\sum _{k=0}^{\log _{2}(l)-1}2^{k}=2^{\log _{2}(l)}-1=l-1$.
- This means that a full binary tree with l leaves has $2l-1$ nodes.

Complete binary trees (like those use in [[Heaps]])
- A complete binary tree  has $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ internal nodes

## Array representation

For a node at index i:
- Left child: 2i + 1
- Right child: 2i + 2
- Parent: $\lfloor{\frac{(i-1)}{2}}\rfloor$
