# Constraint Satisfaction Problem
There are a set of constraints which specify the allowable combinations of values

**Forward checking**: Pre-emptively removes inconsistent values from the domains of neighbouring variables. Prevents unnecessary expansion if constraints have already been violated. This is uninformed and can be improve with heuristics:		

## Constraint Propagation
Propagate the implications of constraints from assigning 1 variable to the other variables.
