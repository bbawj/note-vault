# Game Theory
__Any game with a finite number of actions will have a Nash Equilibrium__

Pure Strategy set: a Nash equilibrium pure strategy exists if there are states which no party can gain a higher utility by choosing a separate action given that the other parties adhere to their current action.

Mixed Strategy set: __when there is no pure strategy, an equilibrium must exist in mixed strategies.__ It is a probability distribution over 2 or more pure strategies.
