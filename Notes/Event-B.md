### Printer Access
- A system should support adding a permission for a student in order to get an access to a particular printer and removing a permission.
- A system should support removing a studentâ€™s access to all printers at once.
- A system should support giving the combined permissions of any two students to both of them.

#### Modelling
- To keep track of changing permissions, it will make use of a variable access whose type is a relation between STUDENTS and PRINTERS.
