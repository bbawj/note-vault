[Safety](Notes/Safety%20and%20Liveliness.md): condition of being protected from harm
Security: degree of protection from harm
# Verification vs Validation
Verification: does the software do things right?
- can be automated by tools to verify specific properties
Validation: does the software do the right thing?
- requires human judgement to think about which are the correct requirements/operations
## Verification
Dynamic analysis: performs at run time analysing the real state of the system
Static analysis: performs at compile time to analyse the simplified state of the system

# Trust
Trust is what we expect the entity to do and not to do.
## Trusted Computing Base
A set of system components that need to be trusted to ensure security. 
### Threat Model
A threat model needs to describe:
1. What is trusted
2. Resources and knowledge/actions the untrusted entities can do
3. Security properties we aim to achieve

An example: phishing email â€“ a malicious email with malware as the attachment
- What is trusted: hardware and OS
- What is not trusted: the email attachment.
- Adversarial capabilities: running malicious code in your computer.
- Security properties: protect the computer system such that the malware cannot steal the sensitive data, or tamper with other processes.
### Security properties
- [Authenticity](Notes/Authentication.md)
- Confidentiality: prevent disclosure of information
- Integrity: prevent modification
- Availability: prevent withholding of information, resources should always be available (DDOS attacks)
- Accountability: actions of an entity can be traced and identified
- Non-repudiation: unforgeable evidence that specific actions occur
### Security Strategies:
- Prevention
- Detection
- Reaction
# Vulnerabilities
- Vulnerability: the weakness of a program that reduces its information assurance  
- Exploit: the technique the attacker takes to compromise the target system  
- Payload: the code the attacker wants the system to run.

## Side channel attack
An attack which is based on extra information that can be gathered because of the fundamental way a computer protocol or algorithm is implemented, rather than flaws in the design of the protocol or algorithm itself.
- Timing attack:  based on measuring how much time various computations (such as, say, comparing an attacker's given password with the victim's unknown one) take to perform.
# Types of malware:

## Cyber Kill Chain
7 steps developed by Lockheed Martin which identifies what adversaries must complete in order to achieve their objectives starting from reconnaissance to data exfiltration.
1. Reconnaissance: harvesting email addresses etc.
2. Weaponization: coupling exploit with backdoor into deliverable payload
3. Delivery: delivering payload via email, USB etc.
4. Exploitation: exploit a vulnerability to execute code on victim system
5. Installation: install malware on the asset
6. Command and Control (C2): command channel for remote manipulation
7. Actions on objectives: accomplish goal
## Case Study (SingHealth)
- The crown jewels of the SingHealth network is the electronic patient medical records stored in the SCM database, an medical record software solution.
- Users access the SCM through Citrix servers

### Key events
1. Attackers gain access into network by infecting front end workstations. They then laid dormant for 4 months before starting lateral movement, compromising many endpoints, servers and administrator accounts
2. Attacker remotely connected to Citrix servers and began ex-filtrating patient records undetected.
	- Used a customised Remote Access Trojan to enable remote shell access to download and upload malicious files. This could not be detected by standard anti-malware solutions
	- Publicly available hacking tool allowed for persistent presence of the account even if the password has been changed
3. Suspicious queries were noticed but were reported to IHiS senior management only 1 month later.
	- No controls to detect and block bulk queries. Database activity monitoring was not implemented.
#### Why
1. IHiS staff did not have adequate levels of cyber security awareness, training and resources.
2. Key staff in IHiS failed to take appropriate effective and timely action to prevent the data ex-filtration
3. There were a number of vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the network which could have been remedied before the attack.
	- Remote access was not regulated with firewalls. Unnecessary open connections between servers and database were allowed.
	- Internet connectivity was not needed but increased attack surface.
	- 2FA could be bypassed
	- Vulnerabilities in Outlook mail software were not patched. 
	- Inactive accounts were not removed immediately
4. Attacker was a skilled and sophisticated actor
	- Employed advance tools, techniques and procedures
	- Suite of advanced and customised malware
	- Persistent, having established multiple footholds and backdoors
	- Extensive C2 network
5. Although cyber defences will never be impregnable, there were opportunities to reduce the success of the attacker.
#### Recommendations
1. Enhance security structure and readiness. Cyber security must be viewed as a risk management issue rather than just a technical one.
2. Cyber stack must be reviewed to assess if its adequate. Gaps in cyber stack must be found by comparing with existing security technologies.
3. Staff awareness must be improved through increasing knowledge.
4. Enhance security checks especially on C2 systems. Vulnerability assessments, certification of vendor products and pen-testing must be conducted regularly.
5. Privileged administrator accounts must be subject to tighter control and monitoring. 2FA, passphrases, password policies must be implemented and enforced.
6. Incident response process must be improved with predefined modes of communication.
7. Partnership with industry leaders in cyber security
